## Overview

The Ciguapa is a legendary creature from Dominican Republic folklore, depicted as a beautiful woman with long, dark hair that covers her entire body and distinctive backwards feet that point opposite to her direction of travel. This unique characteristic makes her impossible to track or follow.

The Ciguapa is nocturnal, living in the mountains and caves, and is known for either seducing and killing men or simply eluding all human contact. Descriptions vary - some portray her as beautiful, others as ugly. She communicates through chirping or bird-like sounds rather than human speech (or chooses not to speak).

The Ciguapa represents wild, untameable feminine nature and embodies Dominican cultural heritage with influences from indigenous Taíno and African traditions. Only hunting dogs can sense her presence, and she cannot be caught or captured.
